I guess that that one tutorial decided my whole life.\n\nAnyway, fast-forward to today; I love programming and work on a series of projects, [maybe yours too](/#contact). I love open-source, hence why this website and many other projects are open to the public!\n\nI am still young which means plenty of time to grow and improve, below you can find a list of languages, tools and software which I use at a daily basis." as const;
